- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ysg-linux
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Physics and the collaboration of technology, programming and Physics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Linux and Python, trying to get a more intuitive understanding of how they can be utilized in research.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on my public email ysg.linux24@gmail.com

I am a fairly social person and would be excited to talk to and learn from some of the more experienced people here. Maybe even collaborate on something fun?
